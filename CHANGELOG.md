# Masque: Raeli r19-Release
### Changed
* The original Raeli skin has changed names once again from Raeli - Square to **Raeli - Square Edge**.

### New
* The Square skin now comes in two variants, Edge and Inset. Edge is the same skin you are used to. Inset makes the icon slightly smaller and adds a tiny inner black border so the edge border stands out better when the edge border is coloured.
  * Use Square Edge for actionbars where the border is black,
  * Use Square Inset for bag addons or where the border might be colored.

* A new variant has also been added for the Ring skin. The original ring Skin is the now called **Raeli - Ring Inset**, with the edge skin being a variant that suits usage with actionbar buttons.

* New Spells Highlight and Spell Highlight have been added. (when you hover over an ability in your spellbook and it highlights the actionbutton)
