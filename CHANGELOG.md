# Masque: Raeli r18-Release
### Changed
* The Raeli skin is now called Raeli - Square inside Masque Options. You'll need to set your masque settings to this skin again.

### New
* Added a new Skin called Raeli - Circle. It is as similar as I can make it to the square skin but it's circular instead.
* Added a Gloss to the Square skin - I prefer it off, but the option is now there if you want it.
* Slightly repositioned text elements
* Altered default options slightly
